We then use this method to generate a catalog of all such designs with up to three four-level factors, 20 two-level factors, and 128 runs.

There, I met Peter Goos who became my Ph.D.¬†promoter. I am now studying design of experiments and their applications to robustify protocol for cell-based bio-assays. I am currently working on the enumeration and characterization of large regular mixed-level designs."
