There, I met Peter Goos who became my Ph.D. promoter. I am now studying design of experiments and their applications to robustify protocol for cell-based bio-assays. I am currently working on the enumeration and characterization of large regular mixed-level designs.\n\n\n\nKU Leuven | Leuven, Belgium\nPh.D. in Design of Experiments | September 2019 - Present\nM.S. in Statistics | Specialization in Biostatistics | September 2017 - September 2019\nUCLouvain | Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium\nM.S. in Bioscience engineering | Specialization in Soil and Water management | September 2015 - September 2017\nB.S. in Bioscience engineering | Specialization in Environmental sciences | September 2011 - September 2015"
