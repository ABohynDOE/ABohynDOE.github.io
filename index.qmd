After graduating from UCLouvain in Soil and Water management, I developed an interest for statistics than led me to do a master in Statistics in KU Leuven. There, I met Peter Goos who became my Ph.D. promoter. I am now studying design of experiments and their applications to robustify protocol for cell-based bio-assays. I am currently working on the enumeration and characterization of large regular mixed-level designs.
